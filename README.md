Hi, I’m Markus - a molecular biologist and data analyst with expertise in the molecular mechanisms of cancer development and progression. 
Beyond the lab, I’m a passionate conservationist volunteering with BUND Naturschutz in Munich, focusing on amphibian conservation. 
I’m excited to pivot towards tech-driven solutions for sustainability challenges.
